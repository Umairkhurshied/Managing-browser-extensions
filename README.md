# Managing-browser-extensions
This task focused on identifying and removing suspicious browser extensions to enhance browser security and improve performance. I began by opening my browserâ€™s extensions/add-ons manager and reviewing all installed extensions in detail. For each extension, I checked its permissions, ratings, and reviews to determine whether it was legitimate and necessary. Any extensions that were unused, had excessive permissions, or came from unknown publishers were flagged as potentially suspicious. I then removed these suspicious or unnecessary extensions, ensuring that only trusted tools remained. After removal, I restarted the browser to verify performance improvements and stability. Finally, I researched how malicious extensions can harm users, including risks such as data theft, tracking, and unauthorized access to sensitive information. This process reinforced the importance of regularly auditing installed extensions as a preventive security measure.
